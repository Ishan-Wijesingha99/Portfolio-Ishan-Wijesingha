                    I can work as a frontend developer using React JS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, or just plain ES6 JavaScript. I can also work end-to-end as a full stack developer using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, Express JS, React JS, Node JS). I've created multiple business-level full stack applications using React and MERN.

                <p className="text-xl text-justify">
                    I've worked in agile teams to create frontend and full stack applications collaboratively using Git, but I can also work alone to create a product that people will love.

                    I have an utter devotion to learning and remaining curious. I love incrementally improving my skills one day at a time. If I do not know something, I will not rest until I have mastered it.

                    I have used many technologies (most of which are listed below), but I also have the passion to learn any new technology, and because I am a quick learner, I can learn it fast.

                    Apart from coding, I love indulging in books, exercise and meditation. I also love chocolate milk (who doesn't).
