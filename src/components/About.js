                        I can work as a frontend developer using React JS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, or just plain ES6 JavaScript. I can also work end-to-end as a full stack developer using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, Express JS, React JS, Node JS).
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p className="text-xl text-justify">
                        I am also very proficient with GraphQL and Apollo, allowing me to create MERNG applications. I can also use MySQL and Sequelize ORM. I've created multiple business-level full stack and frontend applications.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-justify">
                        I've worked in agile teams to create frontend and full stack applications collaboratively using Git, but I can also work alone to create a product that people will love.

                    <p className="text-xl text-justify">
                        I have an utter devotion to learning and remaining curious. I love incrementally improving my skills one day at a time. If I do not know something, I will not rest until I have mastered it.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-justify">
                        I have used many technologies, but I also have the passion to learn new languages and frameworks, and because I am a quick learner, I can learn them fast.

                        Apart from coding, I love indulging in books, exercise and meditation. I also love chocolate milk (who doesn't).
